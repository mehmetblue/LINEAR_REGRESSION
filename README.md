# HOMEWORK- LINEAR REGRESSION
General Explanation:
Applying Linear Regression Models on a dataset selected from Kaggle
Detailed Explanation:
1- Select a dataset from Kaggle and apply the following models on this dataset.
a) Simple Linear Regression
b) Multiple Linear Regression
c) PCR
c) PLS
d) Ridge
e) Lasso
f) Elastic net
2- Prepare the homework on kaggle.
3- When choosing dataset, take care that the data set must include categorical data and convert these categorical data into numerical data (you can use get_dummies method).
4- Your dataset should be a dataset suitable for the regression problem. (dependent values can be salary, age, score etc.)
5- If the number of data in the data you selected is high, the results will be more accurate.
6- Interpret the results. Evaluate which model works best for your data.
7- Make a presentation on kaggle page.
